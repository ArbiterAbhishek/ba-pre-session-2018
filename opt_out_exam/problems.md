# General framework for this assignment:

1. Fork this GitHub repository.
2. Clone your forked repository to your computer.
3. From here on, work in the cloned repository. Make sure that you commit your changes frequently (and that you have meaningful, decent commit messages). Once you are ready with everything (or after major commits) push to your forked repository.
4. After all your work is on GitHub create a pull request. Once you get to this point, you don't have to do anything else. The pull request itself is your submitted assignment.

# I. IT Tasks

1. Create a folder within the `opt_out_exam` folder having the following format `lastname_firstname` with your last name and first name.
2. Within `lastname_firstname` create two folders. One called `IT` and one called `Math`.
3. Write a basic batch file (if you are working on Windows) or a shell script (if you are working on a Unix based system) called `basics.bat` or `basics.sh` and place it to `lastname_firstname/IT/`. It should do the following:
> - First it should create a folder called `made_by_my_script` within  `lastname_firstname/IT/`. Make sure it can be run on any computer (i.e. use relative paths).
> - Then it should echo "Hello world" and redirect the standard output to `lastname_firstname/IT/made_by_my_script/hello.txt`.
4. Run `basics.bat` or `basics.sh`.
